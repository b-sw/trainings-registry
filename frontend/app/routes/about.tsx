                        The war in Ukraine is not over. Every day, Ukrainians ‚Äî both defenders and
                        civilians ‚Äî continue to suffer. Many are injured, displaced, and living
                        through the unimaginable. Among them are thousands who have lost limbs and
                        are now beginning the long journey of physical and emotional recovery.
